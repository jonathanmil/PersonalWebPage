An important and innovated thing that Power+ has is that it allows students to test outcome scores for tests they have. This gives students hope for saving their grades when they think all is lost. In design tech high school grades were hidden to students and Power+ allowed students to really see their grades. This was a challenging moment for students and Power+ was the solution to this problem.</font></p>
